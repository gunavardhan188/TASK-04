Creating a basic keylogger program involves capturing keystrokes and writing them to a file. Below is a simple example using Python with the pynput library, which makes it easier to handle keyboard events. This will log keys pressed to a file named "keylog.txt".

This program listens for keyboard events:
1. Writes normal character keys to a file.

2. Logs special keys (like space, enter, shift) with their names.

3. Stops running when the Escape key is pressed.

Instructions to run:
1. Install pynput if not installed:
pip install pynput

2. Run the Python script.

3. Press keys; it logs into keylog.txt in the same directory.

4.Press Esc to stop the keylogger.

This keylogger is for educational and ethical use only. Running keyloggers without permission is illegal and unethical.
